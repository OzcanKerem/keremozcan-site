        <!-- PROFILE -->
        <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Electrical and Electronics Engineer working at the intersection of research-driven engineering and
          real-world system deployment. My background spans FPGA and embedded systems, RF/SDR signal processing,
          PCB/hardware design, and automation electronics. I am currently continuing my graduate-level specialization
          at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University (AYBÜ) with a focus on quantum circuits, CMOS design thinking,
          PLL-based frequency synthesis, digital signal processing, advanced optoelectronic applications, and
          optical fiber communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          In industry, I lead and deliver automation projects for access control and automatic door systems,
          frequently collaborating with construction companies and on-site teams. I focus on end-to-end delivery:
          requirements, technical planning, field coordination, commissioning, reliability, and after-sales continuity.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer currently pursuing my M.Sc. at
          Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University (AYBÜ). My academic and engineering work
          sits at the intersection of digital hardware, communication systems, and
          emerging computational paradigms. I aim to build a strong foundation that
          combines rigorous analysis with practical implementation.
        </p>

        <h3>Research Interests</h3>
        <p>
          My primary research interests include quantum circuits and related modeling
          approaches, FPGA-based digital system design, and advanced circuit design
          methodologies. I am particularly interested in how modern hardware platforms
          can accelerate computation and signal processing workflows, and how
          design choices impact performance, robustness, and implementation complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also focus on advanced optoelectronic applications and optical fiber
          communication systems, where I explore device/system concepts and signal
          integrity considerations. These domains motivate practical questions around
          modulation, detection, noise behavior, and end-to-end system reliability.
        </p>

        <h3>Applied Engineering</h3>
        <p>
          Alongside academic research, I actively work with embedded systems,
          circuit design, and applied engineering problems. I have hands-on
          experience with smart home technologies, solar energy systems, and
          automatic door and access control systems, combining field expertise
          with solid engineering foundations. In parallel, I maintain an active
          interest in amateur radio technologies and RF systems.
        </p>

        <h3>How I Work</h3>
        <p>
          I value structured engineering: clear requirements, measurable targets,
          careful verification, and clean documentation. Whether the work is academic
          or industrial, I prefer practical outcomes that can be tested, reproduced,
          and improved iteratively. I write short technical notes to capture key
          assumptions, decisions, and results for future reuse.
        </p>
